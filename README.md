# Stochastic diffusions in H2 Sobolev spaces

We describe 2-dimensional shapes in the euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ as elements of $H^2(\mathbb{S}^2, \mathbb{R}^3)$ and so, deformations of the sphere with extra regularity constraints. This approach was popularized by Bauer et al. (ref).

## Description
This Python package aims at computing and visualizing implicit stochastic diffusion processes between shapes. It provides comprehensive functions to easily compute random processes acting on the spherical harmonic decomposition of 3-dimensional shapes.

## Setup and dependencies

The code involves the following libraries:
- numpy
- scipy
- trimesh
- open3d
- imageio
- matplotlib
